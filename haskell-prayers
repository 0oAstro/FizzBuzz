Our Haskell, who art in binary,
hallowed be thy type system,
thy monoids come,
thy will be done,
On VSCode as it is in emacs.
Give us this day our daily recursion
and forgive us as our side effects and infinite loops,
and lead us not into imperative languages,
but deliver us from mutation,
for thine is the type-system and the monoids
and the pure functions, forever.
